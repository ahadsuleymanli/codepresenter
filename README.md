### AI-Driven Code Presentation Tool

In any **knowledge transfer session**, constantly switching between IDE tabs and scrolling through large sections of code can disrupt the flow and clarity of your presentation.

This tool solves that by generating **AI-powered "slides"** from your open tabs in **VSCode** or **Visual Studio**. With a simple prompt, it organizes and positions your code for a **seamless, structured presentation**, removing the need for constant tab-switching and scrolling.

Key features include:
- **Split-view support:** Display different sections of the same file side by side.
- **Custom slide generation:** Focus on specific workflows or code segments.
- **Clickable navigation:** Quickly jump to relevant code sections without leaving presentation mode.

Enhance your code walkthroughs with smooth, distraction-free presentations for any technical discussion or review.

### Looking Ahead
This tool could be expanded beyond knowledge transfer sessions to enhance the overall development experience. By providing greater control over the layout of the userâ€™s environment, developers could easily rely on the AI to take direction from them or, when confident, offer suggestions for fitting additional relevant files on the screen for the user's reference. With increased contextual awareness, the AI could provide tailored suggestions based on the user's current work or answer relevant questions, further streamlining the coding process.
